# Change log

## 5.0.0
**Breaking**

- Updates to PostCSS 6 (https://github.com/borodean/postcss-assets/issues/70, https://github.com/borodean/postcss-assets/issues/71, https://github.com/borodean/postcss-assets/pull/72).
- Drops nodejs 0.12 support.

## 4.2.0
**Features:**

* Add `cache` option to cache resolved dimensions (https://github.com/borodean/postcss-assets/pull/73).

## 4.1.0
**Features:**

* `relative` option supports what `relativeTo` option did in 3.x: if a string is passed, paths are generated relatively to a path in that string. A behavior of relating to input files by passing `true` is kept untouched.

**Under the hood:**

* Code updated to match [Airbnb code style](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
* Tests converted to ES6 syntax.

## 4.0.1
**Bugfixes**
- Works fine with no options provided (https://github.com/assetsjs/postcss-assets/issues/45).

## 4.0.0
**Breaking**
- Removes `relativeTo` option, introduces `relative` one.

  There is no need to specify a particular file to relate to anymore - set `relative` to `true` and Assets would resolve URLs relatively to the current CSS file.

  This solves the issue when you have stylesheets in different folders and want relative paths — previously there was an option to relate only to a single directory.

  (https://github.com/assetsjs/postcss-assets/issues/42)

**Features**
- Load paths now accept globs:

  ```js
  var options = { loadPaths: ['images', 'assets/**/img'] };
  ```

  (https://github.com/assetsjs/postcss-assets/issues/40)

- Load paths now also accept single strings:

  ```js
  var options = { loadPaths: 'assets/**/img' };
  ```

**Bugfixes**
- Really fixes the SVG rendering on Internet Explorer.
- SCSS flags are preserved (https://github.com/assetsjs/postcss-assets/issues/43).
- No more funky file names in the repo to make Windows archiver happy (https://github.com/assetsjs/postcss-assets/issues/35).
- Allows numbers to be returned from the cachebuster function.

**Under the hood**
- Coverage hits 100%.
- Automated tests against the latest stable nodejs, v0.12 and v4.
- Builds are automatically tested on Windows by [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/borodean/postcss-assets).
- Switches tests from Mocha to [AVA](https://github.com/sindresorhus/ava).
- Uses [Calipers](https://github.com/calipersjs/calipers) for image measurement instead of image-size.
- Replaces custom function mapper with [postcss-functions](https://github.com/andyjansson/postcss-functions).
- Extracts assets processing logic to the [Assets](https://github.com/assetsjs/assets) module.
- Cleans up dependencies.

## 3.0.3

- properly calculates dimensions of SVGs with percentage values of `width`/`height` attributes (https://github.com/borodean/postcss-assets/issues/33).
